                    <p class="about__text">Hello, I'm Diego Andre Falla Gallegos, I am a software engineering student
                        with a passion for creating
                        innovative solutions. From a young age, I have been fascinated by the power of technology and
                        how it can
                        transform the way we live and work. As I pursued my education in software engineering, I
                        discovered my
                        aptitude for programming and quickly became enamored with the endless possibilities of software
                        development.
                        <br>
                        In addition to my formal education, I am an avid self-learner and enjoy exploring new
                        technologies in my
                        spare time. I am always seeking out online courses, tutorials, and coding challenges to expand
                        my
                        knowledge and skills. This dedication to continuous learning has enabled me to stay current with
                        the
                        latest trends and and has prepared me to tackle complex projects with confidence.
                        <br>
                        Some of the technologies I have worked with include:
